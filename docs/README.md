## [About](#about)

Next-Todo is a simple todo list app built with **Next.js**, **Prisma**, and **SQLite3**. I wanted to go for a more modern approach for the ui and as for options I was heavily influenced by the ***Todo*** extension in VSCode by *Fabio Spampinato* [fabiospampinato.com](https://fabiospampinato.com).

- Add todos
- Remove todos
- Create new todos
- Select todo importance level
- filter todos by importance level or done todos
- See the creation time and finish times of todos.
- Rearrange todos.

## [Usage](#usage)

To use Next-Todo:

- First pick an importance level or leave it on the efault.
- Next, enter your todo list item text in the input box.
- Once you finished writing your todo item, press the `Add Todo` button to add it to the list and database.

### Reporting a vulnerability or bug?

**Do not submit an issue or pull request**: A general rule of thumb is to never publicly report bugs or vulnerabilities because you might inadvertently reveal it to unethical people who may use it for bad. Instead, you can email me directly at: [paulmccarthy676@gmail.com](mailto:paulmccarthy676@gmail.com). I will deal with the issue privately and submit a patch as soon as possible.
